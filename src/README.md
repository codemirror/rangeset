Range sets provide a data structure that can hold a collection of
tagged, possibly overlapping [ranges](#rangeset.Range) in such a way
that they can efficiently be [mapped](#rangeset.RangeSet.map) though
document changes. They are used for storing things like
[decorations](#view.Decoration) or [gutter
markers](#gutter.GutterMarker.at).
